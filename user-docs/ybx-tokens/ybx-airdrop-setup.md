## How to set up a trustline to YBX

To set up a trustline to YBX, a user must have a Stellar wallet because YBX is a custom Stellar asset.  
The easiest way to establish a trustline is with a [LOBSTR](https://lobstr.co/) wallet.

A trustline can also be established if a user prefers a [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/), [Albedo](https://albedo.link/), or [Rabet](https://rabet.io/) wallet, but the user must go through the [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#?network=public) to set it up. See [this section](ybx-airdrop-setup.md#setting-up-a-trustline-with-stellar-lab) for instructions on this.

## Setting up a trustline with LOBSTR

* Go to the [YBX asset page on LOBSTR](https://lobstr.co/assets/YBX:GBUYYBXWCLT2MOSSHRFCKMEDFOVSCAXNIEW424GLN666OEXHAAWBDYMX).
* Verify the issuing account is `GBUYYBXWCLT2MOSSHRFCKMEDFOVSCAXNIEW424GLN666OEXHAAWBDYMX`
* Verify the issuing domain is [https://script3.io/](https://script3.io/)
