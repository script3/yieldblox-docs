# YBX Tokenomics

## The Five Levels of YBX Productivity:

YBX's tokenomics model has five levels of asset productivity protocol participants can engage in to get the most value out of their YBX tokens.

### Level 0: YBX incentivizes ecosystem participants to lend and borrow on YieldBlox.

The foundation of YBX tokenomics is the [YBX distribution mechanism](./#how-do-i-get-ybx-tokens) that awards lenders and borrowers YBX for lending and borrowing using YieldBlox. This on-ramps new users into the ecosystem and ensures the protocol will always have high levels of liquidity. YBX incentives decrease logarithmically over time, so users should start using YieldBlox as soon as possible!

### Level 1: Users can escrow YBX to earn a portion of YieldBlox protocol revenue.

YBX holders can [escrow](../escrowing.md) their YBX for veYBX, which earns them a portion of YieldBlox protocol revenue. This works by taking ≈10% of borrower interest payments, ≈40% of margin account user interest payments, and ≈90% of FX forward user interest payments and using it to repurchase YBX on the Stellar DEX. The repurchased YBX is distributed to the YBX escrow account, which veYBX holders receive a proportional amount of when their lock period ends.

### Level 2: Users can deposit YBX:USDC or YBX:XLM AMM shares to earn a portion of YieldBlox protocol revenue as well as AMM fees.

Once [AMM](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0038.md)'s are implemented in Stellar, YBX holders will also be able to deposit YBX:USDC or YBX:XLM AMM shares to receive veYBX at the same rate as locking just YBX. Not only will these users earn a portion of protocol revenue, they will also earn trading fees from the AMM shares. This is an especially powerful tool, as YieldBlox regularly trades YBX through normal protocol operations by repurchasing YBX with fees and selling YBX through the [YBX backstop](../../technical-docs/protocol/#ybx-backstop).

### Level 3: Users can use their escrowed YBX or YBX AMM shares as collateral to borrow in the YieldBlox protocol.

Users are permitted to use escrowed YBX as collateral and borrow against it. This allows them to gain liquidity on their escrowed YBX and receive [YBX incentives](./#how-are-ybx-tokens-distributed) for borrowing!

### Level 4: Users can use veYBX to vote on the allocation of YBX incentives to different lending pools.

Users who escrow YBX receive veYBX, which can be used to vote on [incentive allocation governance proposals](../governance.md#ybx-incentive-allocations). These proposals are used to determine how YBX incentives are divided between the lenders and borrowers of assets supported by YieldBlox. Users can vote to increase incentives to certain assets to reward lending or borrowing. This is valuable for [anchors](../why-stellar.md#what-are-anchors) that want to offer higher interest rates to users who lend their anchored asset. A fintech platform anchoring their native platform asset could use veYBX to vote to increase incentives for lenders of their platform asset. This would increase the interest rate they can offer users on their platform. Normal users can vote to increase the incentives allocated to the assets they are currently lending or borrowing.

Additionally, FX forward market sizes are capped to the balance of the underlying asset in the lending pool. If a user (such as a market-making firm) needs a large FX forward market for a certain asset they could use veYBX to vote to increase the incentives for lending that asset, drawing in more deposits and increasing the FX forward market size cap.

### Level 5: Institutions can escrow YBX to increase the size of their lines of credit.

The size of the [lines of credit](broken-reference) offered by YieldBlox is limited by the creditworthiness of the whitelisted institution. If an institution requires a larger line of credit, they can escrow YBX to increase their limit. If they default on their line of credit, the protocol will confiscate a portion of their escrow, so by escrowing, they are improving their creditworthiness.
