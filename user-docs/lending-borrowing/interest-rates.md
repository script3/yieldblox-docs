# Interest Rates

## How do loan interest rates work?

YieldBlox's interest rates are based purely on demand and will fluctuate based on the borrowed assets utilization ratio. Interest rates accrue onto the borrower's liability balance over the lifecycle of their loans, but interest does not need to be repaid until loan repayment.

## What is a Utilization Ratio?

An assets [utilization ratio](../../technical-docs/math.md#utilization-ratio-calculations) is the percentage of deposited assets in the pool that are currently lent out. It is used to calculate the [variable interest rate](../../technical-docs/math.md#interest-rate-calculations) paid by borrowers.

## Where do the interest fees go?

The fees generated by interest are sent to both the lending pool and to the escrow pool. The fees sent to the lending pool will be withdrawn by lenders when they burn their respective pool tokens. The fees sent to the escrow pool are converted to YBX and earned by users who have escrow locked YBX. The rate at which fees are sent to the escrow pool instead of the lending pool is defined on the governance account.
