# Interest Rates

## How do loan interest rates work?

YieldBlox's interest rates are based purely on demand and will fluctuate based on the borrowed assets utilization ratio. Interest rates accrue onto the borrower's liability balance over the lifecycle of their loans, but interest does not need to be repaid until loan repayment.

## What is a Utilization Ratio?

An assets [utilization ratio](../../technical-docs/math.md#utilization-ratio-calculations) is the percentage of deposited assets in the pool that are currently lent out. It is used to calculate the [variable interest rate](../../technical-docs/math.md#interest-rate-calculations) paid by borrowers.

## Where do the interest fees go?

Most of the interest rate fees are sent directly to the lending pool to be distributed to protocol lenders. Lenders will withdraw these fees when they burn their pool tokens. In the future, a portion of fees may be sent to YBX escrow lockers.
